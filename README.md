# ControlMouseWithHandTracking
A simple Python script to track the right hand and use it to control the mouse cursor, close thumb and forefinger together to press the left click. Feel free to play a simple game with it (Recommended game to try: Chicken invader, Star defender,... even CS Go and Minecraft!)
